Near(er) future:
 - Offline messages:  when an online user send a message to an offline user, the offline user must receive it when he is online 
 - Voice/Video communication via WebRTC
 - Design workover (maybe reuse [Kondou's chatapp design](https://github.com/Kondou-ger/oc_chat)
 - Something to notify the user, that he got a message, while he's in a different app, than the chatapp
 - Use the built-in appframework (as soon as it's stable enough)
 - Use angular.js

Far future:
 - Mobile apps
 - Integration with IRC/XMPP/other ownCloud instances/â€¦

TODO's for the websocket server:
 - Fix [CSP issues](https://github.com/owncloud/chat/issues/10) and thus (maybe) make port-opening uneccessary
