Near(er) future:
 - Offline messages
 - Voice/Video communication via WebRTC
 - Design workover (maybe reuse [Kondou's chatapp design](https://github.com/Kondou-ger/oc_chat)
 - Something to notify the user, that he got a message, while he's in a different app, than the chatapp

Far future:
 - Integration with IRC/XMPP/â€¦
